        you check the applicable Terms every time you use our Site so that you
        understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be deemed
        to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any

        such revised Terms of Use are posted. The information provided on the

      <p>15. GOVERNING LAW&nbsp;</p>

      <p>16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        Informal negotiations to expedite resolution and control the cost of any
        dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each
        &quot;Dispute&quot; and collectively, the &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;)
        brought by either you or us (individually, a &ldquo;Party&rdquo; and
        collectively, the &ldquo;Parties&rdquo;), the Parties agree to first
        attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
        provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before
        initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
        notice from one Party to the other Party. Binding Arbitration Any
        dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract, including
        any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be
        referred to and finally resolved by the International Commercial
        Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium,
        Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to the Rules of this ICAC,
        which, as a result of referring to it, is considered as the part of this
        clause. The number of arbitrators shall be three (3). The seat, or legal
        place, of arbitration shall be Lagos, Nigeria. The language of the
        proceedings shall be English. The governing law of the contract shall be
        the substantive law of Nigeria. Restrictions The Parties agree that any
        arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
        individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration
        shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
        authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to
        utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority
        for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on
        behalf of the general public or any other persons. Exceptions to
        Informal Negotiations and Arbitration The Parties agree that the
        following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
        informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking
        to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
        intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or
        arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
        unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this
        provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
        will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
        provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
        decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed
        for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
        jurisdiction of that court.&nbsp;
